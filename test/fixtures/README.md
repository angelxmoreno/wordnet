# Test Fixtures

This directory contains data used for testing the `wordnet` library.

## `fixture.json`

This file contains the expected output for `wordnet.lookup('test')`. It was generated by running the `examples/lookup.ts` script (after temporarily modifying it to output JSON) and capturing the output.

**Note:** This fixture is based on the output of the library itself. For a more robust test, this fixture should be independently verified against another trusted WordNet implementation.

## `wordnet-custom.db/`

This is a copy of the main `db` directory, used for testing the custom database path functionality.

## `empty.db/`

This is an empty directory used for testing the behavior of the library when initialized with an empty database.
